This is a simple java application for Rubik's Cube.

Including:
- 2x2, 3x3, 4x4... NxN manipulation with ascii and 2D display
- keyboard and mouse moves
- AI implementation for 3x3 configuration

Roadmap (with no priority):
- add 3D display ?
- add Android version ?
- optimize AI with more OO code
- arrange classes in packages
- display AI moves ?
